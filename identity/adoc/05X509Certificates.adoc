== PKI and X.509 Certificates
A *Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)* is a set of hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital authentication certificates and manage public-key encryption. Thereby helping an organization establish and maintain a trustworthy networking environment. There is no inherent requirement for using a PKI based solution for enabling secure machine to machine (M2M) communication, but it is the most commonly used solution and lots of software, standards and best practices exists for utilizing it. The choice of using PKI based on the X.509 standard for M2M communication in MCP was thus straightforward.

The key piece in a PKI architecture is a PKI CA (Certificate Authority) which is an entity that issues digital authentication certificates. A digital certificate that certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. An obvious example would be creating a certificate for a vessel, which can serve to certify that a given document was indeed signed by someone in possession of the certificate issued to that vessel.

One of the most important aspects of designing a PKI based architecture is the certificate hierarchy planning because the design will affect how certificates are validated and used by PKI-enabled actors. Normally a PKI based architecture is arranged in a tree like hierarchy with a single root entity in the top and with numerous leaves called sub CAs. Each sub CA can have their own sub CA thereby forming a tree with a single entity at the top. Each leave in the tree is responsible for creating certificates, for example, ships or organizations. The reason for doing this is to be able to delegate the responsibility to different parties. For example, in the case of MCP one could envision that at some point in the future every flag state would be their own sub CA. Having the sole responsibility of issuing certificates for vessels registered under their own flag.  

image::ca.png[title="PKI hierarchy"]

In the current version of MCP we are working with a single sub CA that has the responsibility for issuing all certificates. This sub CA is located at MCP Identity Registry. However, this can gradually be changed to support another PKI hierarchy design.

The most important functionality of a CA is issuing digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. In this model of trust relationships, a CA is a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. In the case of MCP these certificates are typically used to make secure connections between maritime actors over the Internet. A certificate is required in order to avoid the case that a malicious party which happens to be on the path to the target server pretends to be the actual target. Such a scenario is commonly referred to as a man-in-the-middle attack. The client uses the CA certificate to verify the CA signature on the server certificate, as part of the checks before establishing a secure connection. Likewise, the server has the option of inspecting the clients certificate before allowing it to connect.

To issue a new certificate for, for example, a vessel. An administrator for the organization who owns the ship will need to log in to MCP Portal and use its functionality for issuing new certificates. The certificate being issued will contain information about the name of the ship, the owner, the flag state and other attributes such as MMSI and IMO number. In the current implementation there is no validation of this information other than that the organization must have been accepted when signing up. We do not expect this to be a problem for the foreseeable future as the number of participating parties is still relatively small. In the future where a lot of more organizations has been added it might, for example, be possible to integrate with national registries. So an automated check of these information can be made.

After having issued a certificate the administrator can now install it on the ship in some way. The actual logistics about how and where to install it is outside of the scope of the identity registry as this might vary a lot between organizations and projects. This also reduces the functionality of the identity registry to just provide the core functionality of Identity management. Allowing users to be able to build innovative solutions on top of it. This also applies directly to machine to machine communication. The identity registry places no restrictions about what kind of machine to machine communication protocols that should be used. It just provides the basic infrastructure to allow for each machine to authenticate the host in the other end. Letting each project select their protocols if needed.

=== Get MCP Root Certificate

In order to use the certificates issued by the MCP Identity Registry it is needed to add MCP Root Certificates to the relevant trustchain. Here you can download the root certificates for MCP instances:

MCP *Production* environment root certificates as http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/prod-certificate/mc-ca-chain.pem[PEM (one file, primarily for Apache/Nginx)], in http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/prod-certificate/mc-truststore-password-is-changeit.jks[JKS (for Java)] or http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/prod-certificate/mc-ca-certs.zip[a zip with the separate files (for windows)].

MCP *Staging* environment root certificates as http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/staging-certificate/mc-ca-chain.pem[PEM (one file, primarily for Apache/Nginx)], in http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/staging-certificate/mc-truststore-password-is-changeit.jks[JKS (for Java)] or http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/staging-certificate/mc-ca-certs.zip[a zip with the separate files (for windows)].

MCP *Test* environment root certificates as http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/test-certificate/mc-ca-chain.pem[PEM (one file, primarily for Apache/Nginx)], in http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/test-certificate/mc-truststore-password-is-changeit.jks[JKS (for Java)] or http://developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/identity/test-certificate/mc-ca-certs.zip[a zip with the separate files (for windows)].


=== Certificate Attributes
MCP can issue X.509 certificates for the users which can then be used for authentication. Service providers relying on X.509 certificate authentication must obtain and install MCP root certificate into their webservice. 

The standard information present in an X.509 certificate includes:

** *Version* – which X.509 version applies to the certificate (which indicates what data the certificate must include)
** *Serial number* – A unique assigned serial number that distinguishes it from other certificates
** *Algorithm information* – the algorithm used to sign the certificate
** *Issuer distinguished name* – the name of the entity issuing the certificate (MCP)
** *Validity period of the certificate* – start/end date and time
** *Subject distinguished name* – the name of the identity the certificate is issued to
** *Subject public key information* – the public key associated with the identity

The Subject distinguished name field will consists of the following items:


[options="header"]
|===
|Field|User|Vessel|Device|Service|Organization
|CN (CommonName)|Full name|Vessel name|Device name|Service Domain Name|Organization Name
|O (Organization) 5.1+^.>|Organization MRN
|OU (Organizational Unit)|"user"|"vessel"|"device"|"service"|"organization"
|E (Email)|User email||||Organization email
|C (Country) 5.1+^.>|Organization country code
|UID 4.1+^.>|Entity MRN|Organization MRN
|===

An example of the fields for a vessel could look like this:
....
C=DK, O=urn:mrn:mcl:org:dma, OU=vessel, CN=JENS SØRENSEN, UID=urn:mrn:mcl:vessel:dma:jens-soerensen
....
Finally, In additions to the information stored in the standard X.509 attributes listed above, the X509v3 extension SubjectAlternativeName (SAN) extension is used to store extra information. There already exists some predefined fields for the SAN extension, but they do not match the need we have for maritime related fields. Therefore the “otherName” field is used, which allows for using a Object Identifier (OID) to define custom fields. The OIDs currently used are not registered at ITU, but are randomly generated using a tool provided by ITU (see http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/asn1/Pages/UUID/uuids.aspx). See the table below for the fields defined, the OIDs of the fields and which kind of entities that uses the fields.

=== Revocation of certificates

A crucial part of any PKI is to support revocation of certificates, so that certificates that belongs to entities who is no longer trusted, affiliation has change, etc., can be mark as not trusted any more. Anyone who wishes to validate a certificate can then check if the certificate has been marked as revoked. The checking of the certificate revocation status can be done in two ways:

. Call the OCSP interface provided by the Identity Registry for each certificate.
. Periodically download a Certificate Revocation File from the Identity Registry and use it check certificates locally.

The endpoints for both the OCSP interface and the Certificate Revocation File are embedded into the certificates issued by MCP Identity Registry, and are currently https://api.maritimecloud.net/x509/api/certificates/crl and https://api.maritimecloud.net/x509/api/certificates/ocsp.


=== Certificate Authentication Flow

To illustrate the authentication flow the sequence diagram below is provided.

[plantuml]
....
autonumber
User -> Service: User connects using certificate
activate Service
Service -> Service: Client certificate is validated
Service -> "Identity Registry": Request certificate revocation status
activate "Identity Registry"
"Identity Registry" -> Service: Revocation status response 
deactivate "Identity Registry"
Service -> Service: Extract Organization name and attributes for authorization
Service -> User: Return response
deactivate Service
....


=== Obtaining a OpenId Connect Token using a Certificate

It is possible to obtain OpenID Connect Tokens using certificate authentication. The idea is that instead of authenticating by being redirected to an Identity Provider as in the normal OpenID Connect flow, you authenticate at the Identity Broker by using your certificate (that has been issued by MCP Identity Registry). This authentication would work in the same way as when authenticating to any service. When authentication has been succesful the Identity Broker can then issue a JWT-token, which is what the OpenId Connect authentication use. So in effect what we have is a "bridge" between the 2 authentication approaches.

An example of use could be that a device (which has been issued certificates) wishes to authenticate securely with a service, but the service only supports OpenId Connect authentication. Using the approach mentioned above, the device can use its certificate to get an OpenId Connect token, which can then be used to authenticate to the service.

The flow looks like the diagram below:

[plantuml]
....
autonumber
User -> "MCP\nIdentity Broker": User requests OpenId Connect Authentication Code,\nconnects using certificate
activate "MCP\nIdentity Broker"
"MCP\nIdentity Broker" -> "MCP\nIdentity Registry": Request certificate revocation status
activate "MCP\nIdentity Registry"
"MCP\nIdentity Registry" -> "MCP\nIdentity Broker": Revocation status response
deactivate "MCP\nIdentity Registry"
"MCP\nIdentity Broker" -> "MCP\nIdentity Broker": Generate OpenId Connect Authentication\nCode based on the certificate
"MCP\nIdentity Broker" -> User: Return OpenId Connect Authentication Code
deactivate "MCP\nIdentity Broker"
User -> "MCP\nIdentity Broker": User requests OpenId Connect Tokens,\npresents Authentication Code
activate "MCP\nIdentity Broker"
"MCP\nIdentity Broker" -> "MCP\nIdentity Broker": Generate OpenId Connect Authentication Tokens
"MCP\nIdentity Broker" -> User: Return OpenId Connect Tokens
deactivate "MCP\nIdentity Broker"
User -> Service: User connects using OpenID Connect Token
activate Service
Service -> "MCP\nIdentity Broker": Request token validation
activate "MCP\nIdentity Broker"
"MCP\nIdentity Broker" -> Service: Response for token validation
deactivate "MCP\nIdentity Broker"
Service -> User: Return response
deactivate Service
....


==== Example of Obtaining a OpenId Connect Token using a Certificate

In this simple example we will assume that a certificate and key--pair has been issued to the entity who wishes to authenticate. This example makes use of `curl` a commandline tool available on Linux and Mac OS X.

The authentication involves 2 steps: 

. Obtaining a temporary Authorization Code using a certificate.
. Obtaining a OpenId Connect Token using the Authorization Code.

These 2 steps are actually standard in the http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow], though normally certificates are not the standard authentication method.

First we obtain the code by issuing this command:

....
curl --verbose --location --cookie "" --key PrivateKey.pem --cert Certificate.pem 'https://maritimeid.maritimecloud.net/auth/realms/MaritimeCloud/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=cert2oidc&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A99&response_type=code&kc_idp_hint=certificates&scope=openid'
....

Let us break down the command:

* `curl --verbose --location --cookie ""`: `curl` is the tool itself. `--verbose` means it will be in verbose mode, `--location` means curl will follow HTTP redirects and `--cookie ""` activates the use of HTTP cookies which means that cookies received will be remember and used during redirects. We need to follow redirects since that is used by OpenID Connect to go back and forth between servers, and the verbose mode is needed because we would like to see where we are redirected -- especially the last redirect, but more about that later.
* `--key PrivateKey.pem --cert Certificate.pem`: Here the private key and the certificate is given to `curl` in PEM format.
* The last part is the URL which itself is multiple parts:
** Address of the authentication endpoint: `https://maritimeid.maritimecloud.net/auth/realms/MaritimeCloud/protocol/openid-connect/auth`
** Parameters: `client_id=cert2oidc&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&response_type=code&kc_idp_hint=certificates&scope=openid`. These can be also be broken down:
*** `client_id=cert2oidc`: This is a special OpenID Connect client setup to be used for certificate authentication.
*** `redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A99`: This is where the authentication server will redirect to at the end of the authentication. The parameter is URL encoded and decoded looks like this: `http://localhost:99`. This address is meant to be invalid, since we want the last redirect to fail.
*** `response_type=code`: This defines that we uses the Authorization Flow as mentioned above.
*** `kc_idp_hint=certificates`: This tells the Identity Broker that we wants to authenticate using the Certificate Identity Provider.
*** `scope=openid`: And finally, this define that we are using OpenID Connect.

When the command runs it returns a lot of output, due to being in verbose mode. We will not go into detail, but quite a few redirects happens, as described in the sequences diagram above. The last redirect however fails, which is intended. The final output will look something like this:

....
* Issue another request to this URL: 'http://localhost:99?code=uss.Yw6k4rXOJiR6IF4a2Y7tYC1-Eqoo8dHSUwjfuIFDfpI.543a63db-9d22-45f7-85b6-a258059c0825.6826c662-6b68-423a-a248-71bd3e69dab0'
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:99/?code=uss.Yw6k4rXOJiR6IF4a2Y7tYC1-Eqoo8dHSUwjfuIFDfpI.543a63db-9d22-45f7-85b6-a258059c0825.6826c662-6b68-423a-a248-71bd3e69dab0
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* connect to 127.0.0.1 port 99 failed: Connection refused
* Failed to connect to localhost port 99: Connection refused
* Closing connection 1
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 99: Connection refused
....

Here we can recognize `http://localhost:99` from the `redirect_uri` parameter described earlier. We can also see that a `code` parameter is in the url, in this case with the value `uss.Yw6k4rXOJiR6IF4a2Y7tYC1-Eqoo8dHSUwjfuIFDfpI.543a63db-9d22-45f7-85b6-a258059c0825.6826c662-6b68-423a-a248-71bd3e69dab0`. It is this code we need to in the second step of authentication to get the OpenID Connect Tokens. The code is only valid for a very limited time (less than a minute) and can only be used once. We will again use `curl` in the second step:

....
curl --data "grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=cert2oidc&code=uss.Yw6k4rXOJiR6IF4a2Y7tYC1-Eqoo8dHSUwjfuIFDfpI.543a63db-9d22-45f7-85b6-a258059c0825.6826c662-6b68-423a-a248-71bd3e69dab0&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A99" https://maritimeid.maritimecloud.net/auth/realms/MaritimeCloud/protocol/openid-connect/token
....

Again, let us break down the command. In this case the command consist of 3 parts, `curl` -- the tool itself, data-parameters and an URL. We will concentrated on the data-parameters. Note that this is a HTTP POST request, which is why the parameters is supplied in a separate argument and not as part of the URL.

* `grant_type=authorization_code`: This specifies that we will use an authorization code to authenticate ourself in this call.
* `client_id=cert2oidc`: The id of the special client, as mentioned above.
* `code=uss.Yw6k4rXOJiR6IF4a2Y7tYC1-Eqoo8dHSUwjfuIFDfpI.543a63db-9d22-45f7-85b6-a258059c0825.6826c662-6b68-423a-a248-71bd3e69dab0`: The code we obtained earlier.
* `redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A99`: The redirect url, the same as before, though not used for actual redirection in this case.

When this call runs there will be no redirection, so we do not need to tell `curl` to follow redirects. Instead the returned output will be the tokens that we wish to use, in a format like this:

....
{
   "access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJ...uXoHudIM1yiDBYj8g",
   "expires_in":300,
   "refresh_expires_in":1800,
   "refresh_token":"eyJhbGciOiJ...iv7rKSa__IKy983Gg",
   "token_type":"bearer",
   "id_token":"eyJhbGciOiJ...Ycp2GupfpTTgRkhtnw",
   "not-before-policy":0,
   "session_state":"94487eaa-b77f-4b6c-8db1-c574fc6a09da"
}
....

The `access_token` is the token that should be used we communicating with services in MCP context. The token should be embedded in the HTTP header. When using `curl` it can be done like this:

....
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJ...uXoHudIM1yiDBYj8g" https://api.maritimecloud.net/oidc/api/org/DMA
....

The `refresh_token` is used to re-authenticate to get a new set of tokens when the access_token has expired, in this case 300 seconds after it has been issued, as seen in the `expires_in` attribute. The new set of tokens can then be obtain with a HTTP POST like this:

....
curl --data "grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=cert2oidc&refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJ...iv7rKSa__IKy983Gg" https://maritimeid.maritimecloud.net/auth/realms/MaritimeCloud/protocol/openid-connect/token
....
