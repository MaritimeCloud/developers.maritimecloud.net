== Query Filter Format
Most API functions for retrieving service information support an optional field called "query", which can be used to narrow down results based on a set of filter attributes. For example, while a geo-query may return both REST and SOAP services, it is possible to apply a filter so only REST services are returned.

=== Available Filter Attributes
* instanceId
* specificationId
* designId
* name
* comment
* status
* organizationId
* keywords
* version
* mmsi
* imo
* serviceType
* unlocode
* endpointUri
* endpointType

=== Query
The query parameter is a string with the following layout:

 field1:value1 AND field2:value2 AND field3:value3

For example:

 serviceType:VIS AND organizationId:SMA
